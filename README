Geany Development Plugin for Common Lisp
========================================

**This is still very pre-alpha.  Use at your own risk**

Requirements
------------

* Linux (may work on other \*nix, but is untested)
* [[http://geany.org/ | geany]] the oldest version I've tested with is 1.25
* you will need the plugin-dev headers for the above as well.
* GNU Emacs
* Quicklisp installed in default location ($HOME/quicklisp)
* Quicklisp slime helper installed on the above quicklisp

Installing
----------

* `PREFIX=$HOME sh config.sh; make install`
* Select the plugin from the geany plugin manager
* Configure keybindings from the geany plugin manager
* If you wish the "Compile" command to work, copy the `filetypes.lisp` to `~/.config/geany/filedefs` I don't install this by default so as to not clobber any existing customizations that may already be there.
* 

Current Features
----------------

* Jump to symbol definition
* Smart indenting
* Compile current file
* Completion of symbols


Known Bugs
----------

* Tabstop for indentation is hard-coded to 8.  It is strongly recommended that you configure geany to use spaces only for indentation for the time being.
   * Note that geany autodetects indentation, so if you open up a file with tabs it may locally use tabs for indentation
   * You can select "Project->Apply default indentation" to set the local file's indentation to be the same as your project's settings.
* The lisp server does not start up when a new project is created.

  * Either restart geany or close and reopen the project

Unknown Bugs
------------

Probably a lot.
